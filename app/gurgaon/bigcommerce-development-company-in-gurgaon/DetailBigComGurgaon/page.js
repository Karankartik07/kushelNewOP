          Based in Gurgaon, our team designs powerful bespoke applications that
          work greatly, and be closely connected to your BigCommerce store. A
          web app that helps you manage your stock, an internal CRM control
          panel, or web-based customer account management, we can create a

          stratified approvals and pricing processes, all frequent in the
          energetic enterprise environment of Gurgaon.
        </p>
        <h6>User Experience (UX) Design</h6>
        <p>
          Gurgaon online shopper behaviours are digitally mature - and that
          requires intelligent, intuitive ecommerce experiences. Our team of UX
          designers work with behavioural research, wireframe and conversion
          heuristics to create BigCommerce stores that are not only attractive
          in view but also in sales.
        </p>

          product to making a purchase to eliminate friction and increase
          engagement. Our layouts are created on the foundation of user personas
          and device usage patterns and are aimed at fast scanning, recognizable

          spend more time, spend more on the site plus visit it frequently.
        </p> */}
        <h6>Progressive Web App (PWA) Development</h6>
        <p>
          PWAs are the hidden weapon of the rapidly expanding ecommerce brands
          and, in a city like Gurgaon where mobile penetration is high among
          both B2C and B2B customers, they can be a game changer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our PWAs are fully integrated with BigCommerce, load within seconds,
          can be used offline, and act exactly like mobile native applications.
          Your customers can browse, add to cart and even checkout but with the
          speed of lightning and push notifications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether it be product catalogs, with many items, or real-time stock
          update, our PWAs can handle excessive lifting without compromising
          performance. We take care of strategy through deployment with one
          guarantee; your app will stimulate engagement and help you employ
          mobile sales first methods.
        </p>
        {/* <p>
          We make your ecommerce PWA safe, search-engine friendly, and

        <h6>API Integration</h6>
        <p>
          Gurgaon boasts of startups that are fast scaling up and the back
          offices of large enterprises- both dependent on the efficiency of
          system connectivity. Our focus is in BigCommerce API integrations to
          tie all your other tools together, including CRMs, ERPs, shipping, and
          analytics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Is there a need to synchronize orders with Zoho or SAP? Automate
          Klaviyo emails? Be able to track delivery through Delhivery APIs? We
          have tried it all safe and at scale.
        </p>
        <p>
          We deal with the full lifecycle: consultation, integration readiness,
          error management, testing, and performance monitoring - so systems

          custom frontends and potent backend engines. We create
          high-performance, SEO-friendly storefronts as well as intelligent
          backend inventory and order routing systems and business logic
          automation.

        <p>
          Whether you are a high-SKU D2C brand or have a complex B2B catalog, we
          ensure an eased integration with the user interface and internal
          systems. Our framework of choice is building around React, Node.js,
          and Laravel with reliance on the APIs provided by BigCommerce to bring
          us a store that is not only beautiful but also powerful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gurgaon business frequently requires localization, GST-enabled
          functionality, and a complicated logic for logistics, and we can
          provide exactly that.
        </p>

          tools, and custom APIs, so your ecommerce system can be as lean as it

        </p>
        <h6>Customization Techniques</h6>
        <p>

          are brought forward, suggested, and provided as well. We use
          customization methods to make sure your BigCommerce shop will showcase
          your unique advantage.
        </p>
