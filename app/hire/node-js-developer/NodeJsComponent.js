                      Developing plugins for Node.js is an interesting field
                      that allows developers to add powerful new functionality.
                      Integration of node apps can be done with C++ or with
                      other programming languages. Developing plugins increases
                      the functionality and reach of Node apps, boosting both
                      scalability and efficiency.
