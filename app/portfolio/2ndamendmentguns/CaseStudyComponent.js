          <div>
            <h5>1. Regulatory Complexity</h5>
            <p>
              Selling firearms requires compliance with a Federal Firearms
              License. The business has to pass through age verification,
              location-based restrictions, and a lot of other things to be
              eligible to run an <b>E-commerce shopping</b>.{" "}
            </p>
            <h5>2. Outdated Platform</h5>
            <p>
              The previous website had many issues, such as UI and UX design,
              performance, and improper infrastructure. It was becoming a
              hindrance to traffic growth and scalability.
            </p>
            <h5>3. Limited Search Experience</h5>
            <p>
              As the inventory is large, finding the right product is pretty
              difficult. The users have to struggle because no advanced
              filtering and search refinements are there.{" "}
            </p>
            <h5>4. Mobile-Friendliness</h5>
            <p>
              Many of the potential customers exist on mobile, but the site
              wasn’t mobile-friendly.{" "}
