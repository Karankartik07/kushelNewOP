              Before we started working on the project, there were the following
              challenges to tackle:-
            </h5>
            <h5>
              1. The interface was disappointing, making it difficult to find
              the product.
            </h5>
            {/* <p>Selling firearms requires compliance with a Federal Firearms License. The business has to pass through age verification, location-based restrictions, and a lot of other things to be eligible to run an <b>E-commerce shopping</b>. </p> */}
            <h5>
              2. The platform’s <strong>ecommerce design</strong> wasn’t up to
              the mark to represent the brand identity.{" "}
            </h5>
            {/* <p>The previous website had many issues, such as UI and UX design, performance, and improper infrastructure. It was becoming a hindrance to traffic growth and scalability.</p> */}

            </h5>

            <h5>
              4. Page loading was too slow, and this was pushing people away
              from the site.
            </h5>
            {/* <p>Many of the potential customers exist on mobile, but the site wasn’t mobile-friendly. </p> */}
